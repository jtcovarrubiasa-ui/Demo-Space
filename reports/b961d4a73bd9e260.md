The Terrestrial-Orbital Compute Arbitrage: A Techno-Economic Analysis of Gas-Fired Datacenter ArchitecturesExecutive SummaryThe digital infrastructure sector currently faces an unprecedented divergence between the exponential demand for artificial intelligence (AI) compute capacity and the linear, constrained growth of utility-scale power transmission. With interconnection queues in major North American data center hubs now extending between 36 and 72 months 1, the traditional model of grid-dependent facility development has become untenable for hyperscale operators requiring gigawatt-scale deployment timelines of 12 to 24 months. Consequently, the industry is witnessing a structural pivot toward "Behind-the-Meter" (BTM) architectures, where data centers effectively become industrial power plants with a compute offtake, decoupling from public utility constraints through on-site natural gas generation.This report provides an exhaustive techno-economic analysis of the capital expenditures (Capex) and operational expenditures (Opex) required to construct and operate a datacenter powered primarily by on-site natural gas turbines. It dissects the cost basis of every critical subsystem—from the thermodynamics of aeroderivative propulsion to the photonic economics of fiber interconnects—to establish a normalized "Cost per Watt" ($/W) economic model for terrestrial infrastructure.Furthermore, this analysis juxtaposes the terrestrial cost basis against the emerging economics of orbital compute constellations (Starlink-class). As terrestrial facilities face mounting costs for land, thermal management, and regulatory compliance, the orbital domain offers a unique inversion of economic inputs: trading expensive land and active cooling for launch mass and radiation hardening. By identifying the specific "cost buckets" that vanish in orbit versus those that appear, this report delineates the precise economic crossover points where the arbitrage between Earth-based and space-based compute becomes viable.The findings herein suggest that the fully burdened capital cost for a terrestrial, gas-fired AI datacenter ranges between $12.00 and $15.00 per Watt of critical IT load.3 This valuation is increasingly driven not by the IT equipment itself, but by the hardened industrial infrastructure required to support it—specifically the integration of complex combined-cycle thermal power plants and liquid cooling topologies required to manage thermal densities exceeding 100 kW per rack.1. On-Site Natural Gas Turbine Generation: Capital and Operational EconomicsThe strategic decision to utilize on-site natural gas generation fundamentally reclassifies the datacenter asset class. No longer merely a commercial real estate holding with heavy electrical service, the facility becomes a critical infrastructure asset subject to the complex economics of the hydrocarbon power generation market. The primary economic driver in this domain is the selection of the prime mover—specifically, the choice between aeroderivative turbines, which prioritize flexibility and speed, and heavy frame turbines, which prioritize thermodynamic efficiency and baseload capacity.1.1 Turbine Technology Selection and ThermodynamicsThe selection of turbine technology is strictly governed by the intended load profile of the datacenter's compute workload. AI training clusters, which typically run at steady-state high utilization for weeks or months, economically favor the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle configurations. Conversely, inference workloads, which may exhibit bursty diurnal patterns, may require the rapid ramp rates characteristic of aeroderivative units.Aeroderivative Gas Turbines (Simple Cycle)Aeroderivative gas turbines, such as the General Electric LM6000, LM2500, or LM9000 series, are essentially modified aviation jet engines adapted for stationary power generation. Their lightweight construction and high compression ratios allow for rapid startup—typically reaching full load in under 10 minutes.5 This capability is critical for datacenters operating in a hybrid model, where the turbines must rapidly ramp up to firm intermittent renewable sources or respond to grid instability.However, this performance commands a significant capital premium. Market analysis for the 2024-2025 period indicates that the installed cost for simple cycle aeroderivative gensets in the 50–100 MW range has stabilized at approximately $1,175 per kW.3 For smaller, modular deployments (e.g., 30–50 MW blocks tailored to specific data hall phases), diseconomies of scale can push unit costs to between $1,200 and $1,500 per kW.7 The "overnight" capital cost—excluding financing—for a twin-unit 100 MW aeroderivative plant is estimated at $123.5 million.3From a thermodynamic perspective, these units operate at lower efficiencies in simple cycle mode compared to their heavy frame counterparts. The heat rate—a measure of the thermal energy required to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity—typically hovers around 8,357 Btu/kWh (Lower Heating Value) for advanced units like the LM6000 PF+.8 This corresponds to a thermal efficiency of approximately 41% to 42% under ISO conditions.5 While lower than combined cycle plants, the waste heat is high-grade and can be utilized for absorption chilling in datacenter cooling loops, potentially recovering system-level efficiency.Heavy Frame Turbines (Combined Cycle)For hyperscale campuses with baseload power requirements exceeding 200 MW—typical of gigawatt-scale AI training clusters—heavy frame turbines (F-Class, H-Class, or J-Class) arranged in a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) configuration represent the standard for economic efficiency. In a CCGT system, the exhaust heat from the gas turbine is captured by a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) to drive a secondary steam turbine. This thermodynamic cascading boosts the net plant efficiency to over 60% in modern H-class units.The capital economics of CCGT plants are currently experiencing significant volatility due to supply chain constraints and raw material inflation. While historical benchmarks often cited costs near $1,000/kW, recent projects with completion dates in the 2030 horizon are reporting costs approaching $2,000/kW.9 However, for projects executing in the 2024/2025 window, authoritative data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Sargent & Lundy places the overnight capital cost for a single-shaft H-Class combined cycle plant (approx. 430 MW) in the range of $1,084/kW to $1,116/kW.3 Larger multi-shaft configurations (1,100 MW+) benefit from economies of scale, potentially lowering the installed cost to $950/kW.10The operational advantage of the H-Class turbine is its superior heat rate, which can be as low as 6,200 to 6,560 Btu/kWh.6 This 25% improvement in fuel efficiency over aeroderivative units translates to tens of millions of dollars in annual fuel savings for a continuously running datacenter. However, the trade-off is operational rigidity; these massive thermal machines require 30 to 60 minutes to start and are sensitive to thermal cycling, making them ill-suited for load-following bursty compute tasks without battery buffering.1.2 Balance of Plant (BoP) and Gas Infrastructure EconomicsThe turbine package itself typically accounts for only 40% to 50% of the total power plant Capex. The remainder is consumed by the Balance of Plant (BoP), a complex array of auxiliary systems including fuel gas compressors, water treatment facilities (essential for steam injection and cooling), and civil works.Pipeline Interconnection and TapsThe lifeline of a gas-fired datacenter is the high-pressure interstate natural gas pipeline. The physical connection to this infrastructure involves significant engineering and regulatory costs.Tap and Metering Station: The physical "tap" into a transmission-level pipeline, along with the custody transfer metering station and pressure regulation skid (to step down pressure from ~800-1000 psi to turbine inlet requirements), represents a discrete capital project. Costs for a station capable of serving a large industrial load range from $5 million to $8 million.11Pipeline Lateral Construction: Unless the datacenter is sited directly adjacent to the mainline, a "lateral" pipeline must be constructed. Construction costs for these laterals are highly variable based on terrain, crossing rights, and diameter (typically 12-24 inches for power plants). Estimates for 2024 place this cost at $1.5 million to $4.5 million per mile.11 This cost includes the procurement of high-grade steel pipe, trenching, welding, and hydrostatic testing.Firm Transport Reservation: Beyond the physical pipe, the operator must secure the right to move gas. "Firm Transport" agreements guarantee fuel availability during peak demand (e.g., winter heating events). These reservation charges act as a fixed capacity payment, estimated at $12.00 to $17.00 per kW-year of equivalent plant capacity.14 This is a sunk cost regardless of actual gas consumption, functionally increasing the facility's fixed Opex.1.3 Emissions Control Systems: The Regulatory TaxOperating a fossil-fuel plant of this magnitude attracts intense regulatory scrutiny. Compliance with the Clean Air Act, specifically New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and local air permitting requirements, mandates the installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR):The primary pollutant of concern is Nitrogen Oxide (NOx). Controlling NOx requires an SCR system, which injects a reductant (typically ammonia or urea) into the exhaust stream over a catalyst bed to convert NOx into nitrogen and water.SCR Capex: The capital cost for installing SCR systems on new combined cycle units typically falls between $28/kW and $40/kW.15 For a 400 MW plant, this is a $12M–$16M line item.Operational Impact: The SCR system imposes a parasitic load on the plant (backpressure reducing turbine output) and requires continuous consumption of ammonia. The "ammonia slip" (unreacted ammonia escaping the stack) is also regulated, requiring precise injection control systems.Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Readiness:The regulatory landscape is shifting rapidly. The EPA's recent Section 111 rules mandate that new base-load gas plants (operating above 40% capacity factor) entering service after 2032 must achieve 90% CO2 capture.16 While immediate implementation is not yet universal, prudent engineering requires "CCS-Readiness"—allocating space and tie-in points for future capture equipment.CCS Cost Impact: Designing for CCS readiness adds approximately $50–$100/kW in immediate engineering and land allocation costs. Full implementation of CCS technology, should it be triggered, is projected to increase the total plant Capex to over $2,400/kW—effectively doubling the cost of the generation asset.171.4 Operational Expenditures (Opex) and Fuel SensitivityWhile Capex determines the barrier to entry, Opex determines the long-term viability of the project. Opex is bifurcated into fixed components (staffing, insurance, scheduled major maintenance) and variable components (fuel, consumables).Fuel Cost Sensitivity:Natural gas prices are historically volatile. The EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts 2025 Henry Hub spot prices to average $4.30/MMBtu, with significant seasonal variance.18Combined Cycle Sensitivity: At a heat rate of 6,200 Btu/kWh and gas at $4.30/MMBtu, the marginal fuel cost is approximately $0.027/kWh.Simple Cycle Sensitivity: At a heat rate of 8,500 Btu/kWh, the marginal fuel cost rises to $0.037/kWh.This delta of $0.01/kWh, when applied to a 100 MW load running 8,760 hours per year, represents an annual Opex difference of $8.76 million.Maintenance (LTSA):Turbine maintenance is typically contracted through Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSA) with the OEM (GE, Siemens, etc.).Variable O&M: Costs associated with run-hours (consumables, minor parts) are estimated at $3.00 to $5.00 per MWh.Fixed O&M: Costs for staffing, calendar-based inspections, and insurance are estimated at $12.20 to $16.30 per kW-year.3Table 1: Comparative Economics of On-Site Gas Generation (2024/2025 Basis)ParameterAeroderivative Simple Cycle (SC)Frame Combined Cycle (CCGT)Contextual Engineering NotesTypical Unit Scale50 – 100 MW200 – 500 MWModular blocks vs. Centralized PlantRepresentative ModelsGE LM6000 / LM9000GE H-Class / Siemens SGT-8000HAviation-derived vs. Industrial FrameThermal Efficiency (LHV)41% – 43%58% – 62%ISO Conditions (15°C, Sea Level)Heat Rate (LHV)~8,300 Btu/kWh~6,200 Btu/kWhCritical driver of Fuel OpexInstalled Capex ($/kW)$1,175 – $1,500$1,080 – $1,420Includes Equipment + EPC 3Fixed O&M ($/kW-yr)$16.30$12.20Staffing, Insurance, LTSA 3Emissions CapexSCR Required (~$40/kW)SCR Required (~$30/kW)High costs for small units due to scaleStartup Time< 10 Minutes30 – 60 MinutesCritical for grid firming/backup logicWater ConsumptionModerate (Evap Cooling)High (Steam Cycle)Dry cooling options exist at efficiency penalty2. Internal Electrical Distribution: The "Grey Space" Cost StackEven with the generation asset secured, the internal electrical topology of the datacenter—often referred to as the "Grey Space"—remains a massive capital sink. This infrastructure is responsible for conditioning, transforming, and distributing the raw medium voltage (MV) power from the generation yard into the stable, redundant low voltage (LV) power required by the server racks.2.1 Switchgear, Transformers, and Supply Chain ConstraintsThe connection from the turbine yard to the data hall requires a robust network of MV switchgear, step-down transformers, and LV distribution gear.Market Dynamics: The electrical equipment market is currently experiencing severe supply chain constraints. Lead times for medium voltage switchgear have extended to 46–48 weeks, driving pricing up significantly.19 This scarcity is a result of competition between datacenter developers, utility grid modernization projects, and industrial electrification.Cost Allocation: Electrical systems collectively account for 40% to 45% of the total datacenter construction budget 4, making it the single largest cost bucket after the shell.Unit Costs:MV Switchgear: A typical lineup cost ranges from $150,000 to $250,000, heavily dependent on the number of breakers and the arc-flash rating.Transformers: The cost to step down voltage from distribution levels (e.g., 13.8 kV) to utilization levels (480V or 415V) ranges from $15 to $25 per kVA.2.2 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) EconomicsThe UPS system provides the critical "ride-through" capability, bridging the gap between a power quality event (or generator start-up) and the IT load.Chemistry Transition (Li-ion vs. VRLA): The industry has decisively shifted from Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries to Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) chemistries.VRLA: While offering a lower upfront Capex (~$200/kW), VRLA systems require replacement every 3-5 years, have a heavy structural footprint (floor loading), and require strict hydrogen venting.Li-ion: These systems command a higher upfront premium (~$300/kW) but offer a service life of 10-15 years, weigh 60-70% less, and occupy a significantly smaller footprint.20TCO Analysis: Over a 10-year horizon, Li-ion systems demonstrate a 31% lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) compared to VRLA (e.g., $150k vs $217k for a representative 1MW block) due to reduced cooling requirements, lower maintenance, and the elimination of mid-cycle replacements.202.3 Topology and Redundancy CostsThe capital cost of the electrical infrastructure is non-linear with respect to the redundancy tier selected (e.g., Uptime Institute Tier III vs Tier IV).Tier III (N+1): This is the standard for most enterprise and hyperscale facilities, allowing for concurrent maintainability. One extra module is available for every N modules required.Tier IV (2N): This topology requires fully fault-tolerant dual active paths. It effectively doubles the quantity of switchgear, UPS, and distribution cabling, increasing the electrical Capex multiplier from 1.0x to approximately 1.8x.Backup Generators: Even in an on-site gas generation scenario, diesel generators are typically required as a "backup to the backup" to meet Tier III/IV requirements, as the gas supply itself constitutes a single point of failure. Diesel generator sets (2–3 MW units) add approximately $300 to $450 per kW installed to the project budget.22Table 2: Electrical Distribution Cost BreakdownSubsystemUnit Cost Estimate (2024)SourceNotesMV/LV Switchgear$80 – $120 / kW4High volatility due to 48-week lead timesUPS System (Li-ion)$250 – $350 / kW20Includes batteries, cabinets, BMSBackup Generators$300 – $450 / kW22Diesel gensets (Tier 2/4 emissions rated)Busway / PDU$50 – $80 / kW4Final distribution to rackTotal Electrical$700 – $1,000 / kWDerivedRepresents ~40% of total build cost3. Mechanical and Cooling Systems: The Thermal BarrierThe mechanical systems represent the second largest Capex driver and the primary lever for controlling non-IT Opex (Power Usage Effectiveness, or PUE). As AI rack densities surge past 50 kW per rack—approaching 100 kW for NVIDIA NVL72 architectures—the industry is undergoing a forced transition from air cooling to liquid cooling topologies.3.1 Cooling Topology EconomicsAir Cooling (Chillers + CRAH): This is the traditional method utilizing raised floors and Computer Room Air Handlers (CRAHs).Cost Efficiency: The normalized Capex for air-cooled infrastructure is approximately $7.02 per Watt of IT load.24Chiller Economics: Air-cooled chillers typically cost $450–$700 per ton of refrigeration. Water-cooled chillers are less expensive upfront at $400 per ton, but necessitate the installation of cooling towers, pumps, and chemical treatment systems, adding complexity and maintenance.25Physical Limit: Air cooling becomes aerodynamically and economically inefficient beyond 30 kW per rack due to the sheer volume of air velocity required.Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC): This topology brings coolant (water or dielectric fluid) directly to the chip via cold plates.Cost Parity: Contrary to the perception of being a "premium" technology, DLC Capex is reaching parity with air cooling at the facility level. Recent analysis suggests a cost of $6.98 per Watt.24 The high cost of specialized in-rack plumbing is offset by the elimination of massive CRAH units, raised floors, and large ductwork.Coolant Distribution Units (CDU): The CDU is the heat exchanger interface between the facility water loop and the rack technology loop. A CDU capable of handling 300 kW of heat rejection costs approximately $21,500.26Manifolds: In-rack manifolds, which distribute fluid to individual servers, add $1,000 to $2,000 per rack to the bill of materials.3.2 Opex and Sustainability (PUE/WUE)Liquid cooling offers profound Opex advantages. By allowing for higher inlet temperatures—"warm water cooling" up to 45°C (113°F) 27—the need for energy-intensive mechanical refrigeration (compressors) is drastically reduced or eliminated in favor of dry coolers or adiabatic rejection.Energy Efficiency: DLC implementation can reduce total facility energy consumption by 10% to 20% compared to air-cooled equivalents.28 This directly impacts the "fuel bill" of the on-site gas turbines.Water Usage: DLC systems are closed-loop on the technology side. When paired with dry coolers, they can significantly reduce Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), a critical metric in drought-prone regions where water rights are as contested as power rights.Key Insight: The "cost penalty" of liquid cooling is largely an artifact of low-density thinking. At AI densities, the reduction in building volume—liquid pipes take up a fraction of the space of air ducts—and the removal of complex airflow management systems neutralizes the component premium. The transition is capital neutral but operationally superior.4. Structural, Envelope, and Civil WorksThis section details the costs associated with the "Shell and Core"—the physical building, land acquisition, and site preparation. While less technologically complex than the power systems, these costs anchor the project in physical reality and are highly location-dependent.4.1 Land Acquisition and Site PreparationLand Economics: The demand for datacenter-zoned land has caused prices to surge. The weighted average cost for datacenter land is approximately $244,000 per acre ($5.59 per square foot). However, large contiguous parcels (50+ acres) suitable for hyperscale campuses have seen prices rise by 23% year-over-year due to scarcity.29Site Preparation: Before a single column is erected, the land must be graded, drained, and served with utilities. Site preparation costs typically range from $100,000 to $150,000 per acre, heavily influenced by soil conditions and topography.4.2 Building Shell ConstructionThe standard architectural topology for a hyperscale facility is a single-story, tilt-up concrete warehouse with reinforced floor slabs capable of supporting heavy static loads (250+ lbs/sqft).Shell Cost: The cost to construct a "powered shell"—which includes the foundation, steel structure, concrete walls, and roof, but excludes the MEP fit-out—ranges from $105 to $235 per square foot of Gross Floor Area (GFA).4Material Selection:Structural Steel: Steel frames cost $10–$20 per square foot for the material and erection.31Tilt-Up Concrete: This method, preferred for its speed, security, and thermal mass properties, costs $25–$40 per square foot.31Total Development Cost: When fully fitted out with all MEP infrastructure, the total development cost ranges from $600 to $1,100 per square foot.30 This metric highlights that the "building" itself is a minor component of the total asset value compared to the equipment inside it.Table 3: Civil and Structural Cost BreakdownComponentCost Range (2024)UnitSourceLand Acquisition$5.00 – $75.00$/sqft (Land)4Building Shell (Cold)$80 – $160$/sqft (GFA)4Powered Shell$105 – $235$/sqft (GFA)30Total Fit-Out$600 – $1,100$/sqft (GFA)Includes MEP 305. Networking, Fiber Plant, and CommunicationsA datacenter without connectivity is merely a heater. The networking infrastructure involves both the external Wide Area Network (WAN) connections that link the facility to the internet backbone and the internal structured cabling that connects servers within the hall.5.1 External Connectivity (WAN)Dark Fiber Economics: Datacenters typically lease "dark fiber" strands—unlit optical fiber—and light them with their own optical transport gear. Lease rates are highly variable based on route competition.Metro Routes: For connections within a metropolitan area (e.g., Ashburn ring), lease rates range from $150 to $300 per mile/month.32Long Haul Routes: For inter-city transport, rates are lower, typically $50 to $100 per mile/month.33New Construction: If no fiber exists, the cost to trench and lay new conduit and fiber is approximately $50,000 to $150,000 per mile, depending on whether the route is aerial (poles) or buried.345.2 Internal Structured CablingThe shift to AI has drastically increased the density of fiber within the rack. "East-West" traffic—data moving between GPUs for training synchronization—requires massive bandwidth, necessitating high-count fiber trunks.Fiber vs. Copper: High-speed interconnects (400G/800G) exclusively utilize fiber optics (OM4 multimode or OS2 single-mode). Copper cabling (Cat6A) is largely relegated to low-bandwidth management networks (IPMI).Cost Per Rack:Materials: A typical rack of AI compute may require $500 to $1,000 in cabling materials alone (fiber trunks, cassettes, transceivers).Installation: Labor costs for structured cabling are significant, adding $200 to $400 per drop.35Total Budget Share: Structured cabling typically represents 5–7% of the total IT build-out budget, a small but critical percentage. Poor cabling can lead to airflow blockages and maintenance nightmares.6. Consolidated Economic Model: Terrestrial Data CenterSynthesizing the subsystem data, we construct a normalized "Per Watt" economic model for a Tier III AI-ready datacenter powered by on-site gas.Model Assumptions:Scale: 100 MW Critical IT Load.Power Source: On-site Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (N+1 redundancy via grid or diesel backup).Cooling: Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC).Location: US Secondary Market (e.g., Ohio/Texas) to optimize land/gas costs.6.1 Capex Per Watt (Normalized)SubsystemCost Range ($/W)Representative Midpoint ($/W)% of TotalContextual NotesPower Generation$1.10 – $1.50$1.309%Includes Turbines, Gas Lateral, Tap 3Electrical Dist.$4.50 – $6.00$5.2538%Switchgear, Transformers, UPS, Gensets 4Mechanical/Cooling$2.50 – $3.50$3.0022%Chillers, CDUs, Piping, Towers 4Civil & Shell$2.00 – $3.00$2.5018%Shell, Land, Site Prep, Roads 4Networking/Fit-out$1.50 – $2.00$1.7513%Fiber Plant, Racks, Security, BMS 4Total Capex$11.60 – $16.00$13.80 / W100%~$13.8M per MWNote on Scaling: This terrestrial cost of approximately $13.80/W aligns with broader industry benchmarks citing $10M–$15M/MW for recent AI-ready builds. The high variance in the upper bound is typically driven by redundancy requirements (Tier IV) and aggressive timelines requiring expedited shipping of long-lead gear.6.2 Five-Year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)To understand the true cost, we must amortize the Capex and add the Opex.Capex Amortization: Assumed linear over 15 years.Fuel (Gas): $4.30/MMBtu translates to roughly $0.035/kWh in fuel cost.Opex (Non-Fuel): Fixed O&M, Staffing, Maintenance, Water.PUE: 1.2 (Liquid Cooled efficiency).Estimated 5-Year TCO per Watt of IT Load:Capex Component: ~$4.60/W (amortized portion over 5 years)Opex (Energy): ~$1.80/W (assuming continuous operation at $0.035/kWh + PUE overhead)Opex (Maintenance): ~$0.80/W (Fixed + Variable O&M)Total 5-Year TCO: ~$7.20 per WattThis TCO figure highlights that over a short 5-year horizon, the capital cost of the infrastructure still outweighs the operational energy cost. However, as the facility lifespan extends to 15-20 years, the energy component (fuel sensitivity) becomes the dominant economic factor.7. Terrestrial vs. Orbital Comparison ContextTo contextualize the terrestrial gas-turbine model, we compare it against the emerging paradigm of "Orbital Datacenters"—specifically, constellations of compute-enabled satellites (Starlink-class) that process data in the vacuum of space. This comparison reveals a fundamental economic arbitrage.7.1 The Orbital Cost FunctionMass-to-Orbit: The primary cost driver in orbit is launch mass, not land or switchgear.Launch Cost: SpaceX internal cost estimates for a Falcon 9 launch are approximately $15 million.36Payload Capacity: A single launch carries ~22 V2 Mini satellites.Launch Cost Per Unit: ~$680,000 per satellite.Manufacturing Cost: The estimated manufacturing cost for a Starlink V2 satellite is $800,000 to $1 million.38Total Orbital Capex: ~$1.6 million per deployed satellite.Power Economics: In orbit, solar energy is "free" Opex, but requires expensive Capex (solar arrays and batteries for eclipse periods).Power Budget: A V2 Mini has an estimated power budget of ~4 kW.Orbital Capex/Watt: $1,600,000 / 4,000 W = $400 per Watt.7.2 The Arbitrage GapTerrestrial Capex: $13.80 / WOrbital Capex: $400.00 / WAnalysis: The orbital premium is currently approximately 29x.However, this straightforward comparison is nuanced by examining "What cost buckets disappear?"Land & Civil Works: $0 in orbit. No zoning, no grading, no property tax.Cooling Infrastructure: $0 for chillers, water towers, or pumps. Radiative cooling is passive, though it requires radiator mass (which costs launch money).Power Generation Fuel: Fuel is free (solar photons). However, energy storage (batteries) is heavy and expensive to launch.Network Backhaul: Orbital compute offers global low-latency access via laser inter-satellite links, potentially bypassing terrestrial backhaul fees and "meet-me room" cross-connect costs.Conclusion: For general-purpose AI training, terrestrial gas-powered datacenters remain vastly more economical ($13.80/W vs $400/W). The "Orbital Arbitrage" currently only exists for specialized workloads where ultra-low latency (e.g., high-frequency trading) or data sovereignty (avoiding terrestrial jurisdictions) commands a >30x premium, or where the cost of terrestrial backhaul (fiber) to remote locations exceeds the satellite premium.8. Conclusion and Future OutlookThe deployment of on-site natural gas generation for datacenters represents a rational economic response to grid interconnection delays and the relentless baseload power demands of the AI revolution. With an all-in capital cost of approximately $13.80 per Watt, this architecture provides a stable, sovereign power island independent of utility constraints.The primary risks to this model are not technological but regulatory and commodity-based. The requirement for future Carbon Capture (CCS) could increase plant Capex by 50% to 100%, potentially eroding the advantage over grid power. Furthermore, the volatility of natural gas prices introduces a variable Opex risk that solar/wind/nuclear do not face.However, compared to the orbital alternative, terrestrial infrastructure remains the only viable economic model for bulk AI training and inference for the next decade. The "Gas-to-Compute" model is likely to dominate the hyperscale landscape through 2030, bridging the gap until small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) or fusion become commercially viable. The orbital domain will remain a niche for high-value, latency-sensitive compute, constrained by the tyranny of the rocket equation.Data Sources and Citations TableCategoryData PointValue / RangeSource IDTurbineAero SC Capex$1,175 / kW3TurbineFrame CCGT Capex$1,084 / kW3TurbineHeat Rate (CCGT)6,200 Btu/kWh6TurbineGas Fuel Cost$4.30 / MMBtu18EmissionsSCR Capex$28 - $40 / kW15ElectricalSwitchgear Lead Time46-48 Weeks19ElectricalUPS (Li-ion) TCO31% Savings vs VRLA20CoolingLiquid Cooling Capex~$6.98 / W24CoolingCDU Cost (300kW)$21,50026CivilPowered Shell Cost$105 - $235 / sqft4NetworkDark Fiber (Metro)$150 - $275 / mile/mo32OrbitalSatellite Cost~$1M / unit36OrbitalLaunch Cost~$15M (Internal)
