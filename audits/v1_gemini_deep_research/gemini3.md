# **Comprehensive Techno-Economic and Physics-Based Review of Orbital Datacenter Architectures**

## **Executive Summary**

The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has placed unprecedented strain on terrestrial infrastructure, specifically regarding power consumption, thermal rejection, and land acquisition. The proposed concept of "Space Datacenters"—migrating high-performance computing (HPC) and AI training workloads to Low Earth Orbit (LEO)—represents a radical architectural shift intended to bypass these terrestrial constraints. This report provides an exhaustive, first-principles-based review of the proposed project, rigorously scrutinizing the physical, engineering, and economic assumptions underpinning the venture. The objective is to identify fundamental errors in logic, validate constants against verified physical laws, and determine the precise techno-economic conditions required for viability.

The review leverages a dedicated cost model 1, theoretical physics regarding thermal radiation and orbital mechanics, and comparative data from existing satellite constellations such as Starlink.1 The analysis reveals that while the project is not physically impossible, it relies on a convergence of "best-case" scenarios across multiple uncorrelated engineering domains—specifically launch costs, radiative cooling efficiency, and radiation tolerance of commercial semiconductors—that creates a compounded risk profile significantly higher than terrestrial alternatives.

The most critical finding is the identification of a **thermal-radiative bottleneck** that contradicts the popular "cold space" narrative. The assumption that the vacuum of space provides a beneficial heat sink is a dangerous oversimplification; for high-density compute clusters, the vacuum acts primarily as a perfect thermal insulator, necessitating radiator surface areas that may exceed the mass and volume budgets of even next-generation launch vehicles like Starship.4 Furthermore, the radiation shielding assumptions (1 kg/kW) appear insufficient for the long-term reliability of 5nm/4nm GPU architectures, potentially leading to hardware attrition rates that destroy the economic amortization model.6

This report dissects these findings through a rigorous engineering lens, categorized into thermal thermodynamics, radiation physics, power generation, and integrated economics.

**1\. Architectural Baseline and Project Definition**

To accurately critique the feasibility of the Orbital Datacenter project, it is essential to first establish the baseline architecture and the specific claims being made. The proposal involves deploying modular data centers in LEO, utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware (specifically NVIDIA H100/Blackwell class GPUs) for AI training and inference, powered by large-scale solar arrays.2

### **1.1 The Core Value Proposition**

The project argues that terrestrial data centers face hard, non-linear scaling limits. Data centers currently consume approximately 4% of U.S. electricity, a figure expected to double by 2030 and potentially reach 20% by 2050\.2 The constraints are tri-fold:

1. **Power Availability:** Local grids cannot support new GW-scale interconnects without years of delay.  
2. **Thermal Management:** Water for evaporative cooling is becoming a scarce resource, and air cooling is hitting density limits.  
3. **Land Use:** "NIMBY" (Not In My Backyard) opposition and permitting delays slow deployment.9

The "Space Datacenter" thesis posits that migrating to orbit solves all three:

* **Energy:** Solar energy in space is continuous (in specific orbits) and more intense (1361 W/m²) than on Earth.1  
* **Cooling:** The background temperature of deep space (2.7 Kelvin) offers an infinite heat sink.1  
* **Deployment:** Launch costs are plummeting via Starship, allowing mass to be deployed cheaper than terrestrial real estate and power plants can be built.11

### **1.2 Reference Design Parameters**

The review utilizes the constants and variables extracted from the project's source code and documentation, which serve as the "Single Source of Truth" for the analysis.1

| Parameter | Value | Unit | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Target Capacity** | 1,000 | MW | 1 GW total compute capacity 1 |
| **Orbit** | LEO | \- | Implied by latency and Starlink heritage 12 |
| **Solar Irradiance** | 1,361 | $W/m^2$ | AM0 Solar Constant 1 |
| **Bus Voltage** | HVDC | \- | High Voltage DC distribution implied 13 |
| **Specific Power** | 36.5 \- 45 | $W/kg$ | Based on Starlink V2 Mini heritage 1 |
| **Launch Vehicle** | Starship | \- | 100t to LEO capacity assumed 14 |
| **Launch Cost** | 500 | $/kg | Aggressive target (current F9 is \~$2500/kg) 1 |
| **Shielding Budget** | 1.0 | $kg/kW$ | "Lumen Orbit" whitepaper assumption 15 |
| **GPU Failure Rate** | 9.0 | %/yr | "Meta" terrestrial baseline 1 |
| **Hardware Life** | 5 | Years | Amortization period 1 |

The analysis that follows accepts these parameters as the project's *intended* design but subjects each to rigorous physical validation.

## ---

**2\. First-Principles Thermal Analysis: The Thermodynamic Bottleneck**

The most significant physical misunderstanding prevalent in the project's literature—and potentially in its economic modeling—is the characterization of the thermal environment. While the background temperature of deep space ($T\_{space}$) is indeed $\\approx 3$ K 1, a spacecraft does not exist in isolation. It is a body in thermal equilibrium with intense radiative inputs from the Sun and the Earth. The assumption that cooling is "free" or "easier" in space is fundamentally flawed when applied to high-density power dissipation.

### **2.1 The Physics of Radiative Rejection**

In terrestrial data centers, heat is removed via conduction (chip to heatsink) and convection (heatsink to air or liquid). These mechanisms are highly efficient because the transfer medium (air/water) has substantial heat capacity and mass flow. In the vacuum of space, conduction and convection are non-existent once the heat leaves the spacecraft bus. Heat rejection must occur **entirely** through thermal radiation.

The power radiated ($P\_{rad}$) by a surface area ($A$) is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

$$P\_{rad} \= \\varepsilon \\sigma A (T\_{radiator}^4 \- T\_{sink}^4)$$  
Where:

* $\\varepsilon$ is emissivity (assumed 0.90 in the model 1).  
* $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\, W/m^2K^4$ 1).  
* $T\_{radiator}$ is the temperature of the radiator surface.  
* $T\_{sink}$ is the effective temperature of the environment the radiator faces.

The $T^4$ Sensitivity:  
The cooling capacity scales with the fourth power of temperature. This creates a "thermal cliff." Terrestrial GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 have strict junction temperature limits, typically $T\_{max} \\approx 85^\\circ C$ to $105^\\circ C$. The project model assumes a maxDieTempC of 85°C and a tempDropC (thermal resistance from die to radiator) of 10°C, implying a radiator surface temperature of 75°C (348 K).1  
If the radiator temperature drops just slightly, rejection capacity plummets. Conversely, to reject more heat, one must increase the temperature, but the chip limit is a hard ceiling. This leaves **Area ($A$)** as the only scalable variable.

### **2.2 The "Sink Temperature" Fallacy**

A critical error in simplified models is assuming $T\_{sink} \= 3 K$. In LEO, the "sink" is not just deep space. A satellite is sandwiched between two massive thermal sources:

1. **Direct Solar Flux ($G\_s$):** $1,361 \\, W/m^2$.10  
2. **Earth IR Emission ($G\_{IR}$):** Earth radiates heat as a blackbody at $\\approx 255 K$. This flux averages $237 \\, W/m^2$.17  
3. **Earth Albedo ($G\_a$):** Sunlight reflected off Earth's atmosphere. With an average albedo of 0.30, this contributes $\\approx 400 \\, W/m^2$ on the sunlit side.19

Calculation of Net Cooling Capacity:  
To determine the actual heat rejection capability, we must calculate the net flux.  
Assume a flat-plate radiator.

* Best Case (Deep Space Facing): The radiator is oriented perfectly away from the Sun and Earth.

  $$P\_{net} \= 0.90 \\times 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\times (348^4 \- 3^4) \\approx 748 \\, W/m^2$$  
* Realistic Case (Nadir/Earth Facing): To maintain communications or stability, radiators often face Earth. They absorb Earth IR and Albedo.

  $$Input\_{flux} \= \\alpha\_{solar} G\_a \+ \\varepsilon\_{IR} G\_{IR}$$

  Using solarAbsorptivity (0.92) and emissivityRad (0.90) from the model 1:

  $$Input \\approx 0.92(408) \+ 0.90(237) \\approx 375 \+ 213 \= 588 \\, W/m^2$$  
  $$P\_{net} \= P\_{rad} \- Input \= 748 \- 588 \= 160 \\, W/m^2$$

The Implication:  
In the worst-case orbital orientation (facing Earth in sunlight), the specific heat rejection capability drops to a meager 160 W/m².  
To cool a single 1 MW (1,000,000 W) compute cluster, the required radiator area would be:

$$\\text{Area} \= \\frac{1,000,000}{160} \= 6,250 \\, m^2$$

Even in the ideal scenario (748 W/m²), the area required is 1,336 m².  
For context, the International Space Station (ISS) uses enormous ammonia-loop radiators to reject roughly 70-80 kW. A 1 GW constellation would require **6.25 million square meters** of radiators in the conservative case. This massive structural requirement drives up the ballistic coefficient (drag), mass, and launch costs, directly contradicting the "low cost" premise.

### **2.3 Thermal Runaway and Orbital Dynamics**

The project relies on a "Sun-Synchronous Orbit" (SSO) at the terminator (dawn/dusk line) to achieve a sunFraction of 98%.1 While this maximizes power generation, it exacerbates thermal management.

* **Constant Illumination:** The satellite never enters Earth's shadow (eclipse), meaning it never has a "cooldown" period.  
* **Solar Impingement:** If the attitude control system (ACS) drifts even slightly, or if the "Beta Angle" changes due to orbital perturbations 20, direct sunlight ($1,361 W/m^2$) may strike the radiator.  
* Runaway: If sunlight hits the radiator:

  $$Input \= 1361 \\times 0.92 \= 1,252 \\, W/m^2$$  
  $$Rejection \= 748 \\, W/m^2$$  
  $$Net \= \-504 \\, W/m^2 \\quad (\\text{Net Heating})$$

  The system instantly becomes a solar collector, heating up rather than cooling down. This mandates active, fail-safe gimbals and shading structures, adding significant mass and complexity (single points of failure).

### **2.4 The Heat Pump Trade-off**

Snippet 9 mentions using heat pumps to increase radiator temperature. This is physically valid: raising $T\_{radiator}$ to 350K or 400K drastically increases rejection ($T^4$).  
However, heat pumps are governed by the Carnot efficiency limit.

$$COP\_{cooling} \= \\frac{T\_c}{T\_h \- T\_c}$$

To pump heat from a GPU at 85°C ($T\_c$) to a radiator at 120°C ($T\_h$), the compressor consumes electrical power. This parasitic load reduces the power available for compute.

* **Mass Penalty:** Heat pumps (compressors, fluids) are heavy mechanical devices prone to vibration and wear.  
* **Power Penalty:** If the heat pump consumes 20% of the total power, the solar array must be 20% larger, increasing drag and mass.

**Conclusion on Thermal:** The assumption that cooling is "free" is false. Cooling is "expensive" in terms of area and mass. The radiator surface area required is likely **4x to 10x larger** than the solar array area itself, dominating the spacecraft configuration.

## ---

**3\. The Radiation Environment: Component Survivability**

The second major "first-principles" hurdle is the hostile radiation environment of LEO. Terrestrial data centers operate under the protective blanket of the magnetosphere and atmosphere (equivalent to \~10 meters of water shielding). Orbital data centers are exposed to the raw flux of the space environment.

### **3.1 The LEO Radiation Spectrum**

Research snippets identify three primary threats 21:

1. **Trapped Radiation (Van Allen Belts):** High fluxes of protons and electrons. In LEO (e.g., 550 km), the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is the primary hazard zone where the inner belt dips low.  
2. **Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs):** High-energy heavy ions (GeV range) originating from outside the solar system. These are difficult to shield and highly destructive.  
3. **Solar Particle Events (SPEs):** Sporadic bursts of high-energy protons during solar flares.

### **3.2 Verification of Shielding Assumptions**

The project assumes a shielding mass budget of **1 kg per kW** of compute.15 We must rigorously fact-check this density against the physical dimensions of the hardware.

**Hardware Baseline:**

* **Device:** NVIDIA H100 SXM5.  
* **Power:** \~700 W.24  
* **Dimensions:** \~112 mm x 267 mm x 38 mm.25  
* **Surface Area:** The shielding must enclose the device. Approx surface area $A \\approx 2(11.2 \\times 26.7) \+ 2(11.2 \\times 3.8) \+ 2(26.7 \\times 3.8) \\approx 600 \+ 85 \+ 200 \\approx 885 \\, cm^2$.

**Mass Calculation:**

* **Budget:** 1 kg/kW $\\rightarrow$ 0.7 kg for a 700W GPU.  
* **Material:** Aluminum ($\\rho \= 2.7 \\, g/cm^3$).  
* Thickness ($t$):

  $$Mass \= A \\times t \\times \\rho$$  
  $$700 \\, g \= 885 \\, cm^2 \\times t \\times 2.7$$  
  $$t \= \\frac{700}{2389} \\approx 0.29 \\, cm \= 2.9 \\, mm$$

Effectiveness Analysis:  
Is 2.9 mm of Aluminum sufficient?

* **Total Ionizing Dose (TID):** Using SHIELDOSE-2 models for a 550km Polar orbit (worst case for LEO due to belt passes):  
  * **Unshielded:** \>100 krad/year.  
  * **3 mm Al:** Reduces dose to approx **5–10 krad (Si) per year**.22  
* **COTS Tolerance:** Modern 5nm/4nm processes (used in H100s) are inherently somewhat resistant to TID due to thin oxides, but peripheral circuits (power regulators, flash memory) often fail at **10–20 krad**.7  
  * **Result:** With 3mm shielding, the hardware might survive 1–2 years before cumulative damage causes failure. This contradicts the 5-year amortization assumption.1  
  * **Requirement:** To achieve a 5-year life (50 krad tolerance or \<2 krad/yr), shielding thickness would need to increase to **6–10 mm**, doubling or tripling the shielding mass budget to **3 kg/kW**.

### **3.3 Single Event Effects (SEE) and Soft Errors**

Beyond cumulative damage, single particles (GCRs) cause immediate disruptions.

* **Bit Flips (SEU):** High-energy particles deposit charge in the transistor channel, flipping a 0 to a 1\. In terrestrial datacenters, the H100 has a higher error rate than the A100 due to density.27 In space, the flux of capable particles is $100\\times \- 1000\\times$ higher.  
* **Latch-up (SEL):** A particle triggers a parasitic thyristor structure, creating a short circuit. Unless power is cut immediately (microseconds), the chip burns out. Standard COTS GPUs do not have built-in latch-up protection circuits for every sub-block.  
* **AI Training Impact:** AI training is a stateful process lasting weeks. A single corruption in the gradient weights can invalidate the entire run. Checkpointing (saving state to disk) mitigates this but incurs a massive I/O penalty. In space, if SEU rates are high, the system spends more time checkpointing/rebooting than training.

**The "RedNet" Solution:** Snippet 34 suggests software-based mitigation (RedNet) can suppress errors. However, this adds computational overhead and does not protect against destructive Latch-ups. The "Meta" data shows terrestrial clusters already struggle with reliability 1; exacerbating this with radiation creates a high probability of low "Effective Training Time Ratios" (ETTR).

**Conclusion on Radiation:** The 1 kg/kW assumption is optimistic and likely leads to a 2-year lifespan, not 5\. Increasing shielding to ensure 5-year survival destroys the mass budget.

## ---

**4\. Power Generation and Energy Economics**

The project's economic viability hinges on the claim that solar energy in space is cheaper than terrestrial electricity.

### **4.1 Solar Flux and Efficiency**

* **Irradiance:** $1,361 \\, W/m^2$ (AM0).  
* **Generation Window:** In a Dawn-Dusk SSO, the satellite sees the sun nearly 100% of the time.  
* **Comparison:** A fixed panel on Earth (AM1.5, 1000 W/m²) with night/weather has a capacity factor of \~20%. A tracking panel might hit 25-30%. Space offers a **4x to 5x advantage** in raw energy harvest per square meter per day.

### **4.2 The "Bifacial" Advantage**

The model uses a solarAbsorptivity of 0.92.1 Snippets suggest utilizing bifacial panels to capture Earth albedo.28

* **Calculation:**  
  * Front: $1,361 \\, W/m^2$.  
  * Back (Albedo): $1,361 \\times 0.30 \\text{ (Albedo)} \\times \\text{ViewFactor} \\approx 400 \\, W/m^2$.  
  * Total Incident: $1,761 \\, W/m^2$.  
* Efficiency: At 22% efficiency 1, power output $\\approx 387 \\, W/m^2$.  
  This is a legitimate physical advantage.

### **4.3 The Hidden Cost of "Free" Energy**

The fallacy in the snippet "The big savings are... free energy" 9 lies in the definition of cost. In space, energy is **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)**, not Operating Expenditure (OPEX). You "pre-pay" for 5 years of energy by buying and launching the solar array.

**Cost Comparison Calculation:**

* **Terrestrial:** Industrial power at $0.05/kWh.1  
  * 1 kW load for 5 years \= $1 \\times 24 \\times 365 \\times 5 \\times 0.05 \= \\$2,190$.  
* **Orbital:**  
  * To generate 1 kW (end of life, accounting for losses), you need $\\approx 3-4 \\, m^2$ of array.  
  * System Mass (Array \+ Structure \+ PMAD): Assume highly optimized 20 W/kg $\\rightarrow$ 50 kg for 1 kW.  
  * Launch Cost ($500/kg): $50 \\times 500 \= \\$25,000$.  
  * Hardware Cost ($20/W): $1,000 \\times 20 \= \\$20,000$.  
  * **Total Orbital Power Cost:** $\\$45,000$.

Insight:  
The cost to generate 1 kW in space for 5 years is $45,000.  
The cost to buy 1 kW on Earth for 5 years is $2,190.  
This is a 20x cost disadvantage for space power. Even if launch costs drop to $50/kg (Starship best case), the hardware cost ($20/W) still keeps the price at $22,500—still 10x more expensive than grid power.  
This single calculation fundamentally undermines the "cheaper power" argument. The only way space power wins is if terrestrial power prices skyrocket (e.g., to $1.00/kWh) or if space hardware costs drop to near zero.

## ---

**5\. Economic Model Integration: Sensitivity and WACC**

The provided Python model 1 calculates costs but omits standard financial metrics required for infrastructure projects.

### **5.1 The Missing Cost of Capital (WACC)**

Infrastructure projects are finance-sensitive.

* **Terrestrial Data Center:** Funded by REITs or green bonds with WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) of **6–8%**.  
* **Space Venture:** High risk (launch failure, unproven tech). Venture Capital (VC) or high-yield debt requires WACC of **15–25%**.30

Impact:  
Since space requires 100% of costs upfront (Launch \+ Hardware), high WACC penalizes it heavily.

* $100M upfront at 20% interest costs $20M/year in servicing alone.  
* Terrestrial centers pay power bills monthly (OPEX), deferring cash flow.

### **5.2 Amortization Mismatch**

* **Terrestrial:** Buildings last 30 years. Power gear lasts 15 years. Servers last 4-5 years. Residual value is \>0.  
* **Space:** Everything lasts 5 years (optimistic) or 3 years (realistic radiation). Residual value is 0 (burns up in atmosphere).  
* **Refresh Rate:** A 1 GW constellation isn't a one-time launch. It requires a "conveyor belt" of launches to replace 20% of the fleet annually. The ORBITAL\_OPS\_ANNUAL constant of 1% 1 is a gross underestimate; it should be 20% (replacement CAPEX) \+ 5% (Ops).

## ---

**6\. Connectivity: The Data Bottleneck**

Data centers are only useful if they can ingest data and output results.

### **6.1 Laser Inter-Satellite Links (ISL)**

The project envisions "tens of terabits per second" 32 using ISLs.

* **Technology:** Starlink v2 uses optical ISLs at \~100 Gbps.33  
* **Scaling:** To reach terabits, the system needs **Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)** in free space. This requires precise pointing (\< micro-radians).  
* **Formation Flying:** To maintain links at high bandwidth, satellites must fly in rigid formation (kilometers apart). This requires active propulsion to counter differential drag, consuming propellant mass.

### **6.2 The "FedEx" Bandwidth Problem**

For AI training, datasets are massive (Petabytes).

* **Terrestrial:** You can ship a truckload of hard drives (Sneakernet) to the data center. Throughput \= PB/day.  
* **Space:** You must beam the data up.  
  * RF Uplink (Ka/V band): Limited spectrum, \~1-2 Gbps per beam.  
  * Optical Uplink: Blocked by clouds. Requires diversity of ground stations.  
* **Bottleneck:** Uploading the "Common Crawl" dataset (hundreds of TBs) to LEO could take months over RF links. This restricts the use case to "Compute Bound" problems (small code, massive calculation, small answer) rather than "Data Bound" training of Large Language Models (LLMs).

**7\. Comparative TCO Matrix**

The following table synthesizes the analysis into a direct comparison between a Tier 4 Terrestrial Datacenter and the proposed Orbital Architecture.

| Cost Category | Terrestrial Benchmark | Orbital Projection | Techno-Economic Verdict |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Real Estate** | High ($5M-$10M/MW) | Zero (Orbit is free) | **Win for Orbit** |
| **Energy CAPEX** | Low (Grid Connection) | Extreme (Solar Arrays \+ Batteries) | **Major Loss for Orbit (20x cost)** |
| **Energy OPEX** | $0.05 \- $0.10 / kWh | Zero (Sun is free) | **Win for Orbit** (but negated by CAPEX) |
| **Cooling** | Efficient (Water/Air) | Inefficient (Radiators, Mass Heavy) | **Loss for Orbit** (Area constraints) |
| **Hardware Life** | 4-5 Years (Benign Env) | 2-3 Years (Radiation/Thermal) | **Loss for Orbit** (Higher Refresh Rate) |
| **Latency/Data** | Fiber (\<1 ms local) | LEO (20-40 ms), Bandwidth constrained | **Neutral** (Application Dependent) |
| **Risk/WACC** | Low (6-8%) | High (15-25%) | **Loss for Orbit** |
| **Maintenance** | On-site technicians | Impossible (Replacement only) | **Loss for Orbit** |

**8\. Integrated Failure Modes and Fundamental Errors**

Based on this exhaustive review, four fundamental errors in the project's logic are identified:

### **Error 1: The "Cold Space" Thermodynamic Fallacy**

Logic Error: Assuming space is a heat sink equivalent to a cold terrestrial environment.  
Correction: Space is a radiative insulator. Net heat rejection capacity ($160 W/m^2$) is orders of magnitude lower than convective cooling.  
Impact: The radiator mass and surface area required to cool 1 GW of compute will drastically exceed the launch volume and mass budgets of the proposed vehicle fleet, or require operating temperatures that destroy GPU reliability.

### **Error 2: The Energy CAPEX Blind Spot**

Logic Error: Confusing "Fuel Cost" (zero for solar) with "System Cost."  
Correction: The cost to build and launch the power plant into orbit is 10x-20x higher per kWh than buying grid power on Earth, even with Starship's aggressive pricing ($500/kg).  
Impact: The primary economic driver (cheaper energy) is mathematically false.

### **Error 3: Radiation Durability Overestimation**

Logic Error: Assuming 1 kg/kW shielding enables 5-year life for 5nm chips.  
Correction: 1 kg/kW provides \~3mm shielding, insufficient to prevent rapid TID accumulation and frequent SEUs.  
Impact: Hardware will likely fail or require retirement in 2-3 years, doubling the required launch cadence and capital expenditure.

### **Error 4: The Data Gravity Problem**

Logic Error: Assuming terrestrial-grade connectivity (Tbps) is easily achievable.  
Correction: Uplinking petabyte-scale training datasets is a fundamental bottleneck not solved by ISLs (which only help sat-to-sat).  
Impact: The system is unsuitable for the primary target market (LLM training on massive datasets).

## ---

**9\. Conclusion and Strategic Outlook**

The "Space Datacenter" concept, while captivating, currently fails the techno-economic feasibility test when scrutinized under first-principles physics and realistic financial modeling. The project attempts to trade **Land and OpEx** (terrestrial constraints) for **Mass and CapEx** (orbital constraints). Given the current costs of mass (Launch) and the inefficiency of radiative cooling, this trade is unfavorable.

The venture relies on a "stacking" of best-case assumptions:

1. Starship achieving $\<\\$100/kg$ (unproven).  
2. Radiators achieving ideal efficiency despite solar input (physically unlikely).  
3. COTS hardware surviving radiation without massive shielding (contrary to semiconductor physics).

Final Verdict:  
The project is economically non-viable as a competitor to general-purpose terrestrial compute. However, it may find viability in niche markets where sovereignty, physical security, or energy independence justifies a 10x-20x price premium (e.g., military crypto-keys, jurisdiction-free banking, or strategic AI reserves).  
For the project to succeed, the design must pivot from "mass-market AI training" to "high-value, low-data density compute," and the engineering team must radically redesign the thermal architecture to account for the hostile radiative environment of LEO.
