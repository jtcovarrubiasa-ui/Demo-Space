## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment: ✅ MATHEMATICALLY SOUND, ⚠️ ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGING

The orbital vs terrestrial datacenter economic model is **mathematically correct** and uses **well-sourced constants**. All formulas correctly implement first-principles physics (Stefan-Boltzmann thermal equilibrium, degradation-adjusted capacity, NGCC fuel consumption).

**Key Finding:** Orbital solar is currently **4.2x more expensive** than terrestrial at default assumptions ($64.85B vs $15.43B for 1 GW over 5 years).

## Sensitivity Analysis Key Findings

### Launch Cost Impact
| Launch $/kg | Orbital Cost | vs Terrestrial |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| $20 (floor) | $36.0B | 2.3x more |
| $100 | $38.4B | 2.5x more |
| $500 | $50.2B | 3.3x more |
| $1,000 (default) | $64.9B | 4.2x more |
| $2,940 (F9) | $121.9B | 7.9x more |

**Critical Insight:** Even at theoretical floor launch costs ($20/kg), orbital is still 2.3x more expensive. **Launch cost alone cannot achieve breakeven.**

### Breakeven Requirements
For orbital to match terrestrial costs, need **BOTH**:
1. Launch cost ≤$100/kg
2. Hardware cost ≤$8/W (64% reduction from $22/W)

OR achieve specific power >65 W/kg (1.8x current V2 Mini)

### Scenarios Where Orbital Wins
| Scenario | Orbital | Terrestrial | Ratio |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Mid-Term 2030 | $13.9B | $15.4B | 0.90x ✅ |
| Theoretical Floor | $6.2B | $15.4B | 0.40x ✅ |
| Crossover (high gas) | $9.2B | $17.0B | 0.54x ✅ |

## Critical Missing Factors

### High Impact (Could shift results >20%)

1. **Space Radiation Effects on GPUs** - Could increase failure rate 2-5x
2. **Manufacturing Learning Curve** - Could reduce costs 20-50% at scale
3. **Discount Rate / NPV** - Front-loaded costs vs distributed fuel
4. **Technology Obsolescence** - 5-10 year horizon assumes stable compute

### Medium Impact (5-20%)

- Orbital debris risk (+5-20% insurance)
- Communications bandwidth (may limit workloads)
- Station-keeping propellant (+5-15% mass)
- Battery mass for non-terminator orbits (+10-30%)
- Carbon pricing on terrestrial (+$10-50/MWh)

## Thermal Analysis Validation

The bifacial panel thermal model correctly implements Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium:

```
T_eq = (Q_in / (σ × A × ε_total) + T_space⁴)^0.25
```

| Parameter | Range | Result |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Beta 90° (terminator) | Default | 64.2°C ✅ |
| Beta 75° | - | 66.0°C ✅ |
| Beta 60° (hot case) | - | 67.7°C ⚠️ Marginal |
| Low emissivity | 0.5/0.5 | 95.0°C ❌ FAIL |

**Conclusion:** Thermal closure is achievable at terminator orbit with high-emissivity coatings. Lower beta angles become challenging.

## Recommendations

### Model Improvements
1. Add radiation effects model with adjusted GPU failure rates
2. Add battery mass for non-terminator orbits
3. Add discount rate / NPV calculation
4. Add station-keeping propellant budget
5. Add communications throughput constraint

### For Analysis Users
1. Focus on hardware cost reduction pathway (most critical lever)
2. Consider carbon pricing scenarios for terrestrial baseline
3. Note that "breakeven" requires aggressive improvements on multiple fronts
4. Space radiation effects could make reality worse than model predicts

## Conclusion

The model is **sound** and provides a **solid foundation for informed discussion**. The finding that orbital compute is currently ~4x more expensive than terrestrial is **robust** to reasonable parameter variations.

However, the analysis correctly identifies paths to competitiveness:
- Hardware costs dropping to $5-8/W (challenging but physically possible)
- Launch costs dropping to $50-100/kg (plausible with mature Starship)
- Specific power improving to 60-75 W/kg (requires advanced solar tech)

The model's conclusion — **"not obviously stupid, not obviously brilliant"** — is well-supported by the numbers.
